# Limitations
- You need to have a clean tree structure with **unique name file**. No worry about the display in blog ; the `title` key in frontmatter will change it, so you can have a `ezarezozre` name and use a good title like `reading book`. 
- I prefer to encourage you to use the `shortlinks` option in obsidian's link option.
- Obsiously, no obsidian's plugin will work.
- No graph view
- `obs2mk` will don't move the file if you change the category key : you need to manually delete it to prevent duplicate. 
	Using the plugin for Obsidian will do it for you.
- mkdocs and Material Mkdocs doesn't support inline tags, and you will lose link in these tags. The script will add some CSS to them, but you will loose the nested tags.
- Nested tags are not supported
