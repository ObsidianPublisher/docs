title: Limitations

- Obviously, not all Obsidian plugins will work. Only Obsidian plugins that are provided with an API can be converted, such as Dataview (converted to simple markdown) for example.
- `dataviewjs` is not supported
- Mkdocs and Material Mkdocs do not support inline tags, and you will lose links in these tags. See [[snippets and tools#Custom tags attributes|Custom tags attributes]] for more information.
- Nested tags are not supported.
