    - `category: hidden` will do the same.
    - `category: folder1/folder2/` will move the file in `folder2`, under `folder1`
    - `category: folder1/folder2/filename` will rename the file `index` and allow support of [section's index page](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-navigation/#section-index-pages)

[^3]: **Meta tags** are snippets of text that describe a page’s content; the meta tags don’t appear on the page itself, but only in the page’s source code. Meta tags are essentially little content descriptors that help tell search engines what a web page is about. [Source](https://www.wordstream.com/meta-tags)
