You can configure:

1. The share key used by the plugin. By default, it is `share`.
2. Folders excluded. The share key can't work here. Useful if you forget to remove the `share` (or turn it to `false`) and move a file in your archiveâ€¦
	You can use regex here, but you need to enclose the regex between `/`.
3. Add the command to share the file on the file menu (right-click on a file in the explorer or using the three dots) and editor menu (right-click on an open edited note)
4. Add the link's shared note in your clipboard after sharing : 
	- You can set the baselink (note : this can be edited by per-file settings `baselink`).
	- You can also delete some part of the created link. If you need to remove multiple part, just separate the part with a comma. For example, if you want to remove the extension and the index : `index, .md`
	- You have the option to enable a new command in the command palette to create a link to the current opened file. If you want to add in the right-click menu, you can use the [commander](https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-commander) plugin. 
5. You can notify all error in a notice, instead of the console. This option is useful if you don't know how to use the console, and if you debug on mobile.


> [!note] The right-click menu command can also send the file under your cursor if it's a link!
